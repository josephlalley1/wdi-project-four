# Project 4: Coin Agent

### Overview

Coin Agent is a cryptocurrency portfolio tracking application, allowing a user to add the coins that they currently own and track their pricing and data.

### Project Brief

Your app must:
- Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end
- Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database
- Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React
- Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
- Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut.
- Have a visually impressive design to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers.
- Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible.
- Have automated tests for at least one RESTful resource on the back-end, and at least one classical and one functional component on the front-end.

### Trello

I used Trello to make a small outline of the basics that I needed in order to make a good start on the project. In hindsight, a more thorough use of Trello would've been extremely helpful and it is something I will be using more for upcoming projects.

### Challenges and Problems

- One of the biggest challenges through this project was that I had a few different external APIs that I wanted to use to pull data from, and one day before presenting, both of the APIs had problems, so I had to find an emergency new API to replace the broken two.

- Also, a big challenge and problem through this project was that I was ill for a large portion of the days given to complete the project.

---

### Wins

- Formatting and inputting the data from the new external API that I got for the project was a tough challenge but also a huge win for me, as I wanted to experiment with using external APIs to gain some familiarity for future use.

- A big win for myself was that I was able to overcome the new time constraints that I personally felt, as a result of my sickness, and produced a good looking product that may not display the full extent of my skills as a programmer, but I think it shows the extent of my resilience and determination.

### Future Features

Features I would have liked to include:

- Include live charts on the individual coin show pages, showing the data for the last 28 days of that specific coin (using Chart.js).

- Refurbish the styling and possibly make a more attractive front page.
